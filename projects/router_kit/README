Overview:

Router Kit is a simple approach to providing hardware acceleration to an
unmodified Linux system. It is comprised of a single program, rkd
(Router Kit Daemon), which monitors the Linux routing table and ARP
cache and mirrors it down to the NetFPGA2 ipv4 reference router
implementation.

Running Router Kit:

   rkd [-h|--help} [-d|--daemon} [-i|--interval] <in_ms>

rkd should work from the command line without any external
configuration options.  Simply run (./rkd).  To run the process in the
background use -d. You may specify the polling time in milliseconds
using the -i option.

Using Router Kit:

Router Kit is only useful on a Linux host with NetFPGA2 installed, and
the ipv4 reference router bitfile loaded.  Given this setup each port on
the NetFPGA2 card is available to Linux via a nfc* interface (i.e. nfc0,
nfc1, nfc2, and nfc3 assuming a single card is installed).

rkd will attempt to mirror all ARP cache and routing table entries
associate with a NetFPGA interface into hardware.  This provides a very
simple (and familiar) method of of adding entries to the hardware.  For
example, to add a static ARP entry, simply use the arp(8) command.  The
following command will add a static ARP entry.

    arp -s 1.2.3.4 ca:fe:de:ad:d0:d0 -i nfc0

To add an entry into the routing table, use route(8) (or ip(8)). For
example, adding a default entry with a next hop of 10.0.0.1 out of the
first port would look something like:

    rout add default gw 10.0.0.1 dev nfc0

Router kit is not limited to manual manipulation from the command line.
*All* state (including dynamic state) is mirrored.  To wit, running rkd
alongside a standard routing daemon, such as XoRP, or Zebra/Quagga,
should provide hardware acceleration of the forwarding table without any
further configuration (provided the routing software are using
the NetFPGA interfaces for forwarding).

How it Works:

rkd continuously polls the routing table and ARP cache state from
/proc/net/route and /proc/net/arp respectively.  When a change in state
is detected, ./rkd writes the updated state to the NetFPGA through the
register interface.  All traffic not handled by the hardware is DMA'd
to software where it is processed by the Linux kernel.
